# NEruSt-JG - My version of a NES emulator written in Rust!

![title](assets/icon.png)

This is my first ongoing project of building a NES emulator.

With a programming language I still need better experience with.

Along with learning assembly language and machine code.

Surely it can be done, right?

Using this as a reference - https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/chapter_1.html

I will be looking to improve upon this implementation as well as try to add extra features!
