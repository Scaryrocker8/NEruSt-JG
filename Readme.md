# NEruSt-JG - My version of a NES emulator written in Rust!

![title](assets/icon.png)

This is my first ongoing project of building an NES emulator (or any emulator for that matter).

With a programming language I still need better experience with.

Along with learning assembly language and machine code.

Surely it can be done, right?
